# Lab-DataMining
## Lab 1: Data Preprocessing and Data Exploration
- This is 2-member group laboratory.
- Hands-on exploring data through the application of support tools provided by the open-source software WEKA.
- Hands-on preprocessing data in Python.

## Lab 2: Frequent Itemset Mining
- This is indivisual laboratory.
- Use Apriori algorithm to find the most frequent items in transactional database.
- Transform html file into a flat file and Churn analysis(for any purpose).

## Lab 3: ID3 and K-means
- This is 2-member group laboratory.
- This project aims to get hands-on experience in implementing some Classification and clustering algorithms taught in Data Mining and Applications course.
- There are 2 exercises in this project:
  - Binary classification using Decision Tree (ID3 algorithm).
  - Data clustering with K-means clustering.
